**Paperless-ngx Docs** are deployed to [docs.paperless-ngx.com ](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/)via GitHub Pages automatically.

The project documentation uses the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs))
static site generator with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
([GitHub](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)) theme.<br>
All content files (Markdown) and additional assets used in that context are stored in the `/docs` folder of the main paperless-ngx repo.<br>
Furthermore, the single, core MkDocs configuration file can be found in the project root
([mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/blob/main/mkdocs.yml)).
